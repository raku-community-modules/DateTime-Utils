# DateTime::Utils

## Introduction

A collection of libraries to enhance the DateTime object from Raku.
These were at one time part of the original DateTime class within Rakudo,
but were pulled out and made into separate libraries when we decided to keep
the Core as simple as possible.

All of the libraries that were once in here have been pulled out into their
own projects.

This is now a meta project that depends on the new standalone projects.
Basically, a one-stop-shop for depending on useful DateTime enhancements.
